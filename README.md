# spin-qubit
Spin qubit simulation source codes written in MATLAB for research project in Yacoby Group (Feb. 2015 - Dec. 2015). 

The two main classes of this repository (qBit and qState) aim to simulate a system of a single qubit and furthermore two entangled qubits, which evolves over time under an electromagnetic Hamiltonian.
